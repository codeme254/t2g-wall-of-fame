        <AboutText>
          I am a software engineer with a BSc in IT from Murang'a University,
          where I recently graduated. I have a strong passion for software
          development, having developed skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My
          expertise includes building interactive websites, such as a recent
          project for Murang'a University Tech Club, where I am designing pages
          using React. I also have a background in data annotation and
          disability services from a previous role. In addition to my technical
          skills, I have worked on improving my soft skills through mock
          interviews and collaborative sessions. I also maintain a deep interest
          in motorsports, particularly Formula 1. My work schedule is flexible,
          allowing me to dedicate significant time to projects during evenings
          and nights.
