            I am proficient in web development, with skills in JavaScript, HTML,
            and CSS. I have built interactive websites, including a recent
            project for Murang'a University Tech Club, where I used React to
            design various pages.

            In addition to my technical expertise, I have worked on improving my
            soft skills through mock interviews and collaboration. These
            experiences have strengthened my communication and teamwork
            abilities, which are crucial in software development.

            I have experience in working with version control systems like Git
            and GitHub, where I collaborate on projects, manage codebases, and
            handle tasks such as branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.
